This project considers to dig more knowledge of social users. It mainly 
scaper information of Fanfou users by a WFS algorithm but maybe some bugs
exists.

We view Fanfou as a whole giga map, and each user is a seed.


WARNING: Fanfou is a unprofitable platform, you should NEVER abuse this 
project to give the servers too much pressure. You should follow Fanfou SDK
to limit your requests number to a reasonable range.
